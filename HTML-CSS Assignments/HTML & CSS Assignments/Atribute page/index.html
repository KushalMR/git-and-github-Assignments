                Albert Einstein, (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Germany—died April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.), 
                German-born physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. 
                Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.

                Albert Einstein(opens in new tab) is often cited as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. 
                His work continues to help astronomers study everything from gravitational waves to Mercury's orbit.

                <br>
                The scientist's equation that helped explain special relativity – E = mc^2 – is famous even among those who don't understand its underlying physics. 
                Einstein is also known for his theory of general relativity (an explanation of gravity), and the photoelectric effect (which explains the behavior of electrons under certain circumstances); 
                his work on the latter earned him a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.

                <br>
                Einstein also tried in vain to unify all the forces of the universe in a single theory, or a theory of everything, 
                which he was still working on at the time of his death.

                Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, a town that today has a population of just more than 120,000. There is a small commemorative plaque where his house used to stand (it was destroyed during World War II). 
                The family moved to Munich shortly after his birth, according to the Nobel Prize website(opens in new tab), and later to Italy when his father faced problems with running his own business. 
                Einstein's father, Hermann, ran an electrochemical factory and his mother Pauline took care of Albert and his younger sister, Maria.
